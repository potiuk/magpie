"""Pure classifier for the bulk-mode pre-flight no-op skip decision.

This module is the executable spec of the rule table documented in
[`.claude/skills/security-issue-sync/bulk-mode.md`](../../../.claude/skills/security-issue-sync/bulk-mode.md).
Both representations must stay in sync — a PR that changes one
should change the other.

The classifier is intentionally split from the fetch layer
(:mod:`preflight_audit.fetch`) so tests can drive it with synthetic
issue dicts and replays of canned GraphQL responses, without any
network calls.
