"""
Per-harness command files, so a maintainer can ask for an adversarial review
from whichever harness they are in — including asking Claude from Codex.

Every command is the same thin wrapper: it has the agent run the one-line tool
invocation and present the report. The reviewer list is never written into a
command; the tool reads the configured one, and skips the harness's own model.

Claude Code's invocation is always spelled
`uvx --from ~/.claude/magpie/adversarial-review …`, unquoted and with a literal
`~`: that is the exact form the sandbox exclusion names, and a quoted or
expanded path would silently stay sandboxed, where the reviewer CLIs cannot read
their credentials. The path is a link the plugin's SessionStart hook points at
the installed version, so the exclusion needs no wildcard where the version
sits; a `*` there would also match options spliced in at that position. The
other harnesses resolve the newest installed version at run time. No command
bakes a version in, so a plugin upgrade leaves every command valid.
