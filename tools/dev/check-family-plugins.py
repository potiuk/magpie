"""Validate the marketplace plugins against the skills' `family:` frontmatter —
the source of truth.

Checks that every plugin is properly defined:

- every ecosystem manifest that declares the framework version
  (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, the Agent Plugins 1.0 `plugin.json`,
  `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, `gemini-extension.json`, `apm.yml`) mirrors
  `pyproject.toml`'s `project.version` verbatim — including a `.devN` suffix;
- `magpie-setup`'s manifest wires the `hooks/check-upgrade.sh` SessionStart
  hook (which must exist) -- it rides on the one plugin the recommended floor
  always installs;
- the root `plugin.json` conforms to Agent Plugins 1.0 — the pinned `$schema`,
  the name pattern, the closed ten-field set (so a Claude-only component path
  never leaks in), and the same shared metadata as the Claude manifest;
- every `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` entry resolves to a matching,
  uniquely-named `plugin.json` and carries the root manifest's version;
- the Codex and Copilot catalogs (`.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`,
  `marketplace.json`) list every family plugin and no all-in-one, with
  `magpie-setup` installed by default and the rest opt-in;
- for every family declared in a skill's `family:` frontmatter there is a
  `plugins/magpie-<family>/` plugin whose manifest is well-formed, inherits the
  root manifest's shared metadata (version, author, homepage, repository,
  license), and whose `skills/` directory contains exactly that family's skills
  as single-hop symlinks into the shared `skills/<skill>` tree;
- every *substrate* plugin (`SUBSTRATE_PLUGINS` — a framework tool published as
  its own plugin rather than a family of skills) has a well-formed manifest that
  inherits the same shared metadata, declares the exact hook wiring the framework
  expects, and reaches its tool through a symlink that actually resolves.

Drift — a new skill, a changed family, a stale symlink, a malformed or
mis-named manifest, a dangling marketplace entry, a family manifest left behind
at the previous release's version — fails the check.

Run with `--fix` to propagate the version from `pyproject.toml` and regenerate
the family plugins + symlinks + marketplace entries from the frontmatter. A
release bump therefore has one edit point: `pyproject.toml`, then `--fix`.
