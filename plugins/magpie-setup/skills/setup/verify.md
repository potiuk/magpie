# verify — health check of the magpie integration + drift detection

Confirms the framework is wired in correctly so the rest of
the framework's skills resolve from the right paths, and
surfaces any **drift** between the committed lock (project
pin) and the local lock (per-machine fetch). Also runs
[`reconcile`](reconcile.md)'s sweep read-only and, the one
comparison no other surface makes, checks every installed
plugin against the marketplace clone for a newer version
(dev builds included). Read-only by default — surfaces gaps
and remediation commands; writes only the always-local
`verified_at` timestamp on completion.

## Inputs

- `--auto-fix-symlinks` — *exception to read-only*. If the
  snapshot is present but symlinks are missing or dangling
  in **any active target dir** ([`agents.md`](agents.md) —
  `.agents/skills/`, `.claude/skills/`, `.github/skills/`, plus
  any present holdout), recreate them across all of them. For
  a fresh worktree whose gitignored symlinks didn't follow the
  checkout, prefer [`worktree-init`](worktree-init.md), which
  shares the main checkout's snapshot as well as relinking. The
  `post-checkout` hook does **not** call this — a slash command
  is not shell-callable (check 8 below rejects a hook that
  carries the long-removed `--auto-fix-symlinks` line).

## Pre-flight

1. `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` — must succeed.
2. **Framework checkout?** Detect structurally (as in
   [`install.md` Step 0](install.md#step-0--pre-flight)):
   `skills/setup/SKILL.md` exists at the repo root with
   `name: magpie-setup` and `skills/list-skills/` is present. If
   so **and** `.apache-magpie.lock` records `method: local`, the
   repo is **self-adopted** — run the
   [Local self-adoption checks](#local-self-adoption-checks)
   instead of the snapshot checks below, then stop. A framework
   checkout with no `method: local` lock is simply not adopted
   yet — point at `setup`.
3. If `<repo-root>/.apache-magpie.lock` is missing, the repo is
   not on the pinned snapshot install. That is **not** the same
   as "not installed" — the default install is the marketplace
   one, which writes nothing to the repo. Check for it (see
   [Marketplace-install checks](#marketplace-install-checks));
   if Magpie is plugin-installed, run those checks and stop. If
   neither is present, surface "not installed" and point at
   `setup install`.

## Marketplace-install checks

Run these when the repo has no committed lock and Magpie is
installed as a plugin — the default install path. There is no
snapshot, no lock, and no symlink to check: the plugin *is* the
install, and the agent's own plugin manager owns its lifecycle.
Report, do not remediate. **Also run checks 8i, 11 and 12 below** —
the adversarial-reviewer check, the read-only reconciliation sweep
and the latest-available-plugin-version comparison apply to every
project regardless of adoption state, marketplace or snapshot,
adopted or merely configured; they are not specific to this branch.

1. **Which plugins are active, and at what version.** Read the
   client's plugin state — Claude Code:
   `~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json` plus the version in
   the cached `…/apache-magpie/<plugin>/<version>/`; Codex:
   `codex plugin list`; Gemini: `gemini extensions list`. Report
   the family plugins installed and the version each is on.
2. **Marketplace registered and reachable.** The `apache-magpie`
   marketplace appears in the client's known marketplaces
   (Claude Code: `~/.claude/plugins/known_marketplaces.json`),
   and whether it tracks `main` or is pinned to a tag. ⚠ if it
   is registered but no Magpie plugin is installed.
3. **Update path.** State the two commands for this client
   (marketplace update, then plugin update) — a plugin compares
   **version strings**, so a stale marketplace clone reports
   "already at the latest" indefinitely
   ([`marketplace.md`](../../../../docs/setup/marketplace.md#automatic-upgrade-detection)).
   Check 12 below runs the actual per-plugin comparison this item
   only names the commands for.
4. **No half-snapshot left behind.** ⚠ if `.apache-magpie/`,
   `.apache-magpie.local.lock`, or any `magpie-*` symlink exists
   without a committed lock — a snapshot install was started and
   abandoned, or was removed by hand instead of with
   `setup uninstall`. Both installs live at once is the
   double-install trap in
   [`SKILL.md` Golden rule 10](SKILL.md#golden-rules); name it.
5. **Override surfaces (informational).** A plugin-installed
   skill still reads `<skill>.md` from the personal layer and
   from `.apache-magpie-overrides/` at run time.
   Report where the personal layer is (`personal_dir` from
   `python3 -m setup_preflight.layers`:
   `<git-common-dir>/apache-magpie/` in a repo that has adopted
   nothing, which needs no ignore entry), whether it and the
   overrides exist, and flag a legacy in-tree
   `.apache-magpie-local/` in an unadopted repo — the pre-flight's
   `legacy-local-dir` finding proposes moving it.
6. **Secure-agent setup.** Report whether it is installed
   (`setup-isolated-setup-verify` is the full check) — a
   marketplace install delivers skills only, and never sandboxes
   the agent.

## Local self-adoption checks

Run these (and only these) when pre-flight detected a framework
checkout self-adopted with `method: local`. There is no snapshot,
no remote lock, and no per-machine lock to drift against — the
committed symlinks into the in-repo `skills/` source *are* the
adoption state.

1. **Marker lock.** `.apache-magpie.lock` parses and records
   `method: local`. ✓ when present; ✗ with a pointer at
   `setup` otherwise.
2. **Symlinks resolve (canonical → source, relays → canonical).**
   In the canonical dir `.agents/skills/`, every `magpie-<n>` is a
   symlink whose target (`../../skills/<n>/`) resolves to a
   directory containing `SKILL.md`. In every **relay** target dir
   ([`agents.md`](agents.md) — `.claude/skills/`, `.github/skills/`,
   plus any present holdout), every `magpie-<n>` is a symlink whose
   target (`../../.agents/skills/magpie-<n>`) resolves through the
   canonical entry to the same `SKILL.md`. ✗ list any dangling or
   non-symlink entry — or any relay that points straight at the
   snapshot/source instead of at `.agents/skills/` — naming the
   target dir; remediation: re-run `setup` (idempotent).
3. **Coverage.** Every `skills/<n>/` with a `SKILL.md` has a
   canonical `magpie-<n>` symlink in `.agents/skills/` and a
   matching relay in **every other active target dir**
   (unless a `skill-families:` filter was deliberately applied).
   ⚠ list any source skill with no link, per target; remediation:
   `setup`.
4. **`.gitignore`.** Each active target dir's `<dir>/*` is
   ignored, with `!/<dir>/magpie-*` un-ignoring the committed
   symlinks — `.agents/skills/`, `.claude/skills/`,
   `.github/skills/`, and any present holdout. ✗ if any un-ignore
   line is missing (those symlinks would not be tracked).
5. **No remote leftovers.** No `.apache-magpie/` snapshot dir and
   no `.apache-magpie.local.lock` — local self-adoption uses
   neither. ⚠ surface either if found (a stale remote adoption was
   not cleaned up).

Checks 11 and 12 below do **not** apply to this branch: there is no
plugin install and no marketplace clone involved in local
self-adoption, and no `.apache-magpie-overrides/` surface a
reconciliation sweep would walk. This branch still writes
`verified_at` on completion — see
[Writing `verified_at`](#writing-verified_at).

## The checks

Run all checks even on early failure (a missing snapshot at
check 1 doesn't tell us anything about the override
directory or doc updates — surface every check).

### 1. Snapshot present + intact

`<snapshot-dir>/` exists (as a directory or a symlink that
resolves to one) and contains the expected top-level files
(`README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.claude/skills/`, `tools/`).

- ✗ if missing **and we are in the main checkout** (`git
  rev-parse --git-dir` equals `git rev-parse --git-common-dir`)
  → run `setup upgrade` (it gracefully handles the
  recover-snapshot case when the committed lock exists but
  the snapshot does not).
- ✗ if missing **and we are in a worktree** (the two dirs
  differ) → run `setup worktree-init` to symlink
  `<snapshot-dir>` to the main checkout's. Do **not**
  propose `upgrade` — that creates a per-worktree snapshot,
  which is the bug `worktree-init` is designed to prevent.
- ⚠ if present as a regular directory **in a worktree** →
  legacy per-worktree snapshot. Suggest
  `setup worktree-init` (with the move-aside flow)
  to convert into a symlink to the main's snapshot. Verify
  continues — the per-worktree snapshot is still functional,
  just wasteful.
- ✗ if missing top-level files → snapshot is corrupted;
  same remediation as the missing-snapshot case above.
- ⚠ if `<snapshot-dir>` is a symlink that resolves outside
  the same repo's main checkout — the operator pointed it
  at a different framework checkout deliberately. Surface
  the resolved target and continue; do not auto-remediate.

### 2. Both lock files exist + parse

`<committed-lock>` (`.apache-magpie.lock`) and
`<local-lock>` (`.apache-magpie.local.lock`) both parse.

- ✗ if `<committed-lock>` is missing → not adopted;
  redirect (already caught in pre-flight).
- ⚠ if `<local-lock>` is missing or unparsable → first
  install on this machine has not run, or the file was
  truncated. Suggest `setup upgrade` to re-create
  the snapshot + write the local lock.

### 3. Drift between committed and local locks

This is the **core drift check**. The same logic every
framework skill runs at the top of its invocation.

Compare:

- `<committed-lock>.method` vs `<local-lock>.source_method`
- `<committed-lock>.url` vs `<local-lock>.source_url`
- `<committed-lock>.ref` vs `<local-lock>.source_ref`
- For `git-branch`: also compare upstream tip (the actual
  current `HEAD` of the branch on the remote) against
  `<local-lock>.fetched_commit`.

| Result | Severity |
|---|---|
| All match (and for `git-branch`, local is at upstream tip) | ✓ |
| Method or URL differ | ✗ — full re-install needed; remediation: `setup upgrade` |
| Ref differs (e.g. project bumped tag, or `git-branch` local is behind upstream) | ⚠ — sync needed; remediation: `setup upgrade` |
| `svn-zip` SHA-512 differs from the verification anchor in `<committed-lock>` | ✗ — security-flagged; the released zip changed content; investigate before upgrading |

### 4. `.gitignore` correctly excludes the snapshot + local lock + symlinks + project-local settings

Check that the entries from
[`install.md` Step 7](install.md) are present in
`<repo-root>/.gitignore`. Required:

- `/.apache-magpie` (snapshot path — **no trailing slash**, so the
  pattern also matches the symlink `worktree-init` puts there; a
  `/.apache-magpie/` entry is a finding, not a pass)
- `/.apache-magpie.local.lock` (per-machine state)
- `/.claude/settings.local.json` (per-machine project-scope
  settings — written to by
  [`sandbox-add-project-root.sh`](../../../../tools/agent-isolation/sandbox-add-project-root.sh)
  as the per-worktree sandbox-allowlist defense for
  [issue #197](https://github.com/apache/magpie/issues/197);
  must never be committed since the content is machine-specific
  absolute paths)
- `__pycache__/` and `*.pyc` (byte-compiled artefacts emitted when
  framework skill scripts run from the adopter checkout; non-anchored
  so they match at any depth)

Recommended (a **uniform** `magpie-*` glob block per **active
target dir** — [`agents.md`](agents.md) — with no per-layout
variation):

- **Canonical target (`.agents/skills/`)** — always present:
  `/.agents/skills/magpie-*` with `!/.agents/skills/magpie-setup`.
- **Relay targets (`.claude/skills/`, `.github/skills/`)** — the
  same two-line block keyed on each dir
  (`/.claude/skills/magpie-*` with `!/.claude/skills/magpie-setup`,
  and likewise for `.github/skills/`).
- **Any present holdout** (`.windsurf/skills/`,
  `.goose/skills/`, …) — the same two-line block keyed on its own
  dir.

- ✗ if `/.apache-magpie` is not gitignored — the snapshot
  is at risk of being accidentally committed. Check this from a
  **worktree** as well as the main checkout: a legacy
  `/.apache-magpie/` entry passes in the main checkout (directory)
  and fails in every worktree (symlink). Remediation is dropping the
  trailing slash, not adding a second entry.
- ✗ if `/.apache-magpie.local.lock` is not gitignored —
  per-machine state would leak into the repo.
- ✗ if `/.claude/settings.local.json` is not gitignored —
  per-machine absolute paths would leak into the repo; the
  sandbox-allowlist helper refuses to write to a non-ignored
  target as defense in depth, but `verify` surfaces the
  underlying `.gitignore` gap so the operator fixes the root
  cause.
- ⚠ if `__pycache__/` or `*.pyc` is not gitignored — byte-compiled
  artefacts from skill scripts could be accidentally committed.
- ⚠ if symlink patterns are not gitignored.

### 5. Symlinks point at live framework skills

Run this check across **every active target dir**
([`agents.md`](agents.md) — `.agents/skills/`, `.claude/skills/`,
`.github/skills/`, plus any present holdout), not just the
`.claude/`/`.github/` pair.

For each `magpie-*` symlink under any active target dir —
canonical ones resolving (via `.agents/skills/`) into
`.apache-magpie/skills/<name>/`, relays resolving through
`../../.agents/skills/magpie-<name>` to the same:

- ✓ if it resolves to a live skill.
- ✗ if dangling (target deleted or snapshot missing), or a relay
  pointing straight at the snapshot instead of at the canonical
  `.agents/skills/` entry, naming the target dir. Remediation:
  `setup install` (idempotent re-run) or this same skill
  with `--auto-fix-symlinks`.

For each framework skill in the snapshot **not** symlinked
in a given active target dir, classify it (a skill missing
from `.agents/skills/` is as much a gap as one missing from
`.claude/skills/`):

- **Always-on family** (every `family: setup` skill *except*
  `setup` itself, and every `family: utilities` skill — read the
  `family:` frontmatter key, per
  [`SKILL.md` Golden rule 8](SKILL.md#golden-rules)) →
  surface as ✗. These families are not opt-in; missing
  symlinks here indicate a broken install or a skipped
  upgrade pass. Remediation:
  `setup verify --auto-fix-symlinks` (cheap), or
  `setup upgrade` (covers the family-wide pass).
- **Opt-in family the project picked** (per
  `<committed-lock>` / `<local-lock>`) → surface as ✗. The
  project declared the family but the install is missing a
  skill from it. Remediation as above.
- **Opt-in family the project did NOT pick** → surface as
  ⚠. The user may have intentionally not picked that
  family; the warning prompts a decision.

The `--auto-fix-symlinks` path repairs the first two
classes in place — in **every active target dir** — without
prompting; the ⚠ class needs an explicit `setup install`
re-run with the family added to the pick.

### 5d. Local configuration, and what it shadows

First say where the personal layer is — the `personal_dir` and
`personal_layers` that `python3 -m setup_preflight.layers` prints:

- **adopted** → `.apache-magpie-local/`, which must be gitignored (✗
  if `/.apache-magpie-local/` is missing from `.gitignore`); in a
  linked worktree with none of its own, the main checkout's, read
  file by file after the worktree's (say so — it is shared with
  every such worktree);
- **not adopted** → `<git-common-dir>/apache-magpie/`, inside the git
  directory, needing no ignore entry. A `.apache-magpie-local/` still
  in the working tree is a ⚠ legacy layout: it is read after the
  personal layer, and the pre-flight's `legacy-local-dir` finding
  proposes the move.

Then read every personal layer. For each file in it, report:

- **fills a gap** — the project commits no file of that name. This is
  the ordinary case for an unadopted repo and for anything the project
  chose not to publish. ✓
- **shadows a committed file, identically** — byte-for-byte the same as
  `.apache-magpie-overrides/<file>`. ⚠, with the one-line consequence:
  it wins under the local-first rule, so a later correction the project
  commits will never reach this clone. Offer to remove it.
- **shadows a committed file, and differs** — ⚠, with the difference
  shown. Never offer to remove this one: it may be the only copy of a
  deliberate local decision. Report it and let the operator decide.

Being shadowed is not a fault and must not be counted as one. It is
reported because the alternative is a contributor wondering for a
month why the project's value is not taking effect.

### 6. `.apache-magpie-overrides/` exists + has the README

`<repo-root>/.apache-magpie-overrides/` is a directory
with the `README.md` scaffold from
[`install.md` Step 9](install.md).

- ✗ if missing → `setup install` (idempotently
  re-creates).
- ⚠ if present but `README.md` is missing — the directory
  may have been hand-created. Suggest re-running
  `setup install`.

### 7. The `setup` skill itself is up to date

Compare the canonical committed `setup` skill
(at `.agents/skills/magpie-setup/`) against the
snapshot's `.apache-magpie/skills/setup/`.

- ✓ if same content.
- ⚠ if different — the adopter's committed copy has
  drifted from the snapshot. The remediation depends on
  *which way* the drift goes:

  - **Snapshot is newer than the committed copy** (typical
    case after a framework upgrade where the adopter has
    not yet rerun `setup upgrade`). Run
    `setup upgrade` — its
    [Step 4b](upgrade.md#step-4b--overwrite-the-committed-setup-from-the-new-snapshot--reload-in-flight)
    auto-overwrites the committed copy with the snapshot's
    version, **reloads the skill in-flight** so the rest of
    the upgrade run executes against the new bootstrap
    content (per
    [`snapshot-model.md` Golden rule 9](snapshot-model.md#the-golden-rules-that-bind-only-here)),
    surfaces local modifications first if any exist, and
    lands the change in `git status` for the user to commit.
  - **Committed copy is newer than the snapshot** (the
    adopter modified the bootstrap skill directly; an
    anti-pattern per the framework's hard rule). The
    framework-side fix is to upstream the modifications as
    a PR against `apache/magpie`; the local fix
    is to revert the modifications and use
    `.apache-magpie-overrides/` instead.

### 8. Post-checkout hook installed *and content matches the framework's expected*

Two sub-checks on `<repo-root>/.git/hooks/post-checkout`:

1. **Presence + executable.** File exists, is executable,
   and carries the current hook body — the sandbox-allowlist
   helper chain (see
   [`install.md` Step 10](install.md#step-10--worktree-aware-post-checkout-hook-fresh-only)).
   It must **not** contain the long-removed
   `setup verify --auto-fix-symlinks` line (a slash
   command is not shell-callable; it printed a spurious error on
   every checkout).
   - ⚠ if missing — strictly optional, but worktrees off this
     repo will then not get their sandbox allowlist added
     automatically on `git worktree add` (they fall back to
     `setup worktree-init`). Print the install recipe.

2. **Content drift vs the framework's expected.** Diff the
   installed hook against the framework's expected hook
   content (the canonical source is shipped under the
   snapshot — locate it during the check). Same logic
   applies for any other adopter-installed local hook or
   config file the framework grows in future.
   - ✓ if content matches.
   - ⚠ if drifted and the diff looks like operator
     hand-edits — surface the diff; remediation is to run
     `setup` (adopt or upgrade), whose
     hook+config-sync pass re-installs from the snapshot
     after asking about hand-edits.
   - ✗ if drifted and the installed content is clearly
     stale (older framework version's recipe) — same
     remediation, no operator prompt needed; the sync
     pass overwrites silently.

### 8a. agent-guard PreToolUse hook active

One check, against whichever of the three installs the operator
uses ([`tools/agent-guard`](../../../../tools/agent-guard/README.md)).
Establish that a `PreToolUse` hook on the `Bash` matcher exists and
that the engine path it names **resolves**; a wired hook pointing at
a file that is not there is the failure mode worth catching, because
a guard that never loads does not raise — it silently stops denying.

1. **Plugin install** — the `magpie-agent-guard` plugin is
   installed. Its manifest carries the hook, so there is nothing
   repository-local to check and nothing to remediate per worktree.
   - ⚠ if no agent-guard install of any kind is found: print
     `/plugin install magpie-agent-guard@apache-magpie`.
2. **Snapshot install** — `<repo-root>/.claude/settings.local.json`
   has a `hooks.PreToolUse` entry (matcher `Bash`) whose command
   runs the engine, and that command's path resolves.
   - ✗ if the entry names a path that does not exist. In
     particular, an entry still pointing at the retired
     per-repository copy
     (`$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/agent-guard.py`) fails in
     every worktree that has no copy — **and breaks every `Bash`
     call there**, since Claude Code surfaces a missing hook script
     as a tool error. Rewrite it to the snapshot path
     (`$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.apache-magpie/tools/agent-guard/src/agent_guard/__init__.py`);
     `settings.local.json` is gitignored and agent-writable, unlike
     the committed `settings.json`, so no operator prompt is needed.
   - Leftover `<repo-root>/.claude/hooks/agent-guard.py` and
     `guards.d/` from an older install are inert once the wiring
     points at the snapshot; report them as removable, do not fail.
3. **User-scope secure setup** — `~/.claude/scripts/agent-guard.py`
   wired from `~/.claude/settings.json`
   ([`setup-isolated-setup-install`](../isolated-setup-install/SKILL.md)).

Skill-owned guards are **not** separately checked: the engine
discovers every `skills/*/guards` in the framework tree it runs
from, so there is no collected copy that can drift out of sync.

This check is worktree-independent. None of the three installs puts
anything in a worktree, so a worktree result never differs from the
main checkout's.

### 8b. Sandbox-allowlist coverage of the current worktree

Defensive cross-check for
[issue #197](https://github.com/apache/magpie/issues/197):
`sandbox.filesystem.allowRead: ["."]` does not in practice cover
CWD under the harness, so `setup` (adopt, upgrade,
worktree-init) chains into
`~/.claude/scripts/sandbox-add-project-root.sh` to add explicit
absolute paths to each worktree's own project-local settings.
This check verifies that chain landed for the *current* worktree.

For the current worktree (resolved via
`git rev-parse --show-toplevel`):

- ✓ if the absolute path appears in **both**
  `<worktree>/.claude/settings.local.json`'s
  `sandbox.filesystem.allowRead` and `sandbox.filesystem.allowWrite`.
- ✗ if missing from either array, **and** the helper script
  `~/.claude/scripts/sandbox-add-project-root.sh` is installed
  — remediation:
  `~/.claude/scripts/sandbox-add-project-root.sh`
  (no `--all-worktrees` needed — just this worktree), or
  re-run `setup` (adopt/upgrade) which chains into
  the helper as part of its Step 12 / Step 6c sandbox-allowlist
  pass.
- ⚠ if missing from either array **and** the helper script is
  absent — the operator has not run
  `setup-isolated-setup-install` yet. Suggest that skill.
  Not ✗ because secure-agent isolation is independent of
  framework adoption, and an adopter who runs without the
  sandbox enabled has nothing to lose by the missing entry.
- ⚠ if `<worktree>/.claude/settings.local.json` is absent
  entirely — same remediation (re-run the helper or
  `setup-isolated-setup-install`). The file is auto-created
  by the helper on first run.
- ✗ if `<worktree>/.claude/settings.local.json` exists AND
  is **not** gitignored (cross-check via `git check-ignore`).
  Per the security rationale in
  [`docs/setup/secure-agent-setup.md` → *Security rationale — why project-local is safe to write to*](../../../../docs/setup/secure-agent-setup.md#security-rationale--why-project-local-is-safe-to-write-to),
  the per-machine settings.local.json must never be committed.
  Remediation: add `/.claude/settings.local.json` to the
  adopter's `.gitignore` (also surfaced by check 4 above).

The check scopes to the current worktree only, not the full
`git worktree list`, because each worktree carries its own
project-local settings file — `setup verify` running
in worktree A has no business asserting on worktree B's file
(which it cannot even reliably read without crossing into
another working tree's path).

This check is read-only on the framework state. The defence
is layered: `setup` writes during adopt/upgrade,
`setup-isolated-setup-verify` adds a live read+write probe
(check 8 there), and this check is the cheap static cross-check
to surface drift between the two skill families.

### 8c. Stale agent-worktrees under `.claude/worktrees/`

Detect worktrees the agent (or a prior session) created under
`<repo-root>/.claude/worktrees/` that have been left lying around
beyond their useful life. **Main-checkout only** — worktrees can
only be inspected from the checkout that owns them, and the
`git worktree list` output is the same across the family anyway.

Stale agent-worktrees are a real friction source: they hold
branches (typically `main`, since `EnterWorktree` defaults to
branching from `main`), so a subsequent `git checkout main` from
the main checkout fails with *"main is already used by worktree
at …"* — silently, in the middle of a longer command pipeline,
producing confusing downstream failures. A session that ended
without explicit `ExitWorktree(action: "remove")` leaves the
worktree on disk; the next session has no way to know it is
abandoned.

The check:

1. Run `git worktree list --porcelain` and filter to entries
   whose `worktree` path is under `<repo-root>/.claude/worktrees/`.
2. For each, compute the **age** — the maximum of:
   - the worktree directory's `mtime` (file-system signal — how
     long since anything inside changed); and
   - `git -C <worktree> log -1 --format=%cI HEAD`'s commit time
     (git-state signal — how recent the latest commit on the
     worktree's branch is).

   The max-of-two avoids two failure modes: a worktree whose
   commits are old but whose files were touched recently (still
   active) and a worktree whose files are old but whose branch
   was recently rebased (still in use). Both look fresh to one
   of the signals alone.

3. Bucket the result against a threshold (default: **7 days**;
   adopter override via `worktree_stale_days` in
   `<project-config>/magpie-setup.md` — if absent, default
   stands):
   - ✓ if age ≤ threshold
   - ⚠ if age > threshold AND the worktree has zero
     uncommitted changes (`git -C <worktree> status --porcelain`
     is empty) — surface the path, age, branch name, and
     propose `git worktree remove <path>` as the cleanup.
   - ✗ if age > threshold AND the worktree has uncommitted
     changes — surface the same info plus an explicit
     *"uncommitted changes present"* warning, and propose
     two-step cleanup: first commit-or-stash, then
     `git worktree remove --force <path>` (or
     `EnterWorktree(path)` to enter it interactively and
     decide).

4. The check is **read-only**: it never auto-removes a
   worktree, never force-anything. The proposal lands in the
   verify-report and the operator chooses to act.

**Threshold rationale.** Agent-worktrees are designed for
per-task isolation: open, work, close. A worktree older than
7 days is overwhelmingly a session that ended without explicit
cleanup. Lower thresholds (3 days, 1 day) hit false-positive
on multi-day tasks that legitimately stretch across sessions;
higher thresholds (14, 30 days) let the bug class persist
long enough to actually break a `git checkout main` weeks
later.

**Why this check exists separately from worktree-init.**
`worktree-init` wires up a newly-created worktree. There is
no symmetric step for end-of-life: `EnterWorktree(action:
"remove")` from inside a session removes it cleanly, but
sessions that crash, get interrupted, or end via context-
window-exhaustion leak. This check is the periodic cleanup
sweep that catches the leakage.

### 8d. Permission allow-list hygiene

Audit the adopter's per-machine permission allow-list for
patterns that grant arbitrary code execution, and surface
the recommended read-only patterns the framework's skills
use heavily. **Local-state only** — the framework never
mutates `.claude/settings*.json`; this check produces
*proposals* the operator confirms before any write.

Two files to read:

- `<repo-root>/.claude/settings.json` (committed,
  project-wide).
- `<repo-root>/.claude/settings.local.json` (gitignored,
  per-machine — same security model as
  `.apache-magpie.local.lock`).

For each, parse the JSON, walk `permissions.allow[]`, and
bucket each entry against two canonical lists.

**Forbidden — propose removal (✗ per entry hit):** broad
wildcards over interpreters, shells, and package runners.
Treat any of the following allow-list strings as an
arbitrary-code-execution hole, regardless of how the
adopter justified adding them:

- `Bash(python *)`, `Bash(python3 *)`,
  `Bash(node *)`, `Bash(bun *)`, `Bash(deno *)`,
  `Bash(ruby *)`, `Bash(perl *)`, `Bash(php *)`,
  `Bash(lua *)`
- `Bash(bash *)`, `Bash(sh *)`, `Bash(zsh *)`,
  `Bash(fish *)`, `Bash(eval *)`, `Bash(exec *)`,
  `Bash(ssh *)`
- `Bash(npx *)`, `Bash(bunx *)`, `Bash(uvx *)`,
  `Bash(uv run *)`
- `Bash(npm run *)`, `Bash(yarn run *)`,
  `Bash(pnpm run *)`, `Bash(bun run *)`,
  `Bash(make *)`, `Bash(just *)`, `Bash(cargo run *)`,
  `Bash(go run *)`
- `Bash(gh api *)`, `Bash(docker run *)`,
  `Bash(docker exec *)`, `Bash(kubectl exec *)`,
  `Bash(sudo *)`

The list mirrors the *"Never allowlist a pattern that
grants arbitrary code execution"* rule from Claude Code's
user-level `/fewer-permission-prompts` slash command — the
framework's copy lives here so adoption itself is not
silently contingent on a sibling skill being present.
**It is not exhaustive**: an allow-list entry that fits
the *same category* (anything that can spawn an arbitrary
process or shell out via a flag) is a ✗ even if its exact
token does not appear above.

**Recommended — propose addition (⚠ per entry missing):**
narrow read-only patterns the framework's skills invoke
often. An adopter who picks up the `security` family will
hit these constantly; pre-allowing them removes the
repetitive confirmation prompts without weakening the
boundary. Tailor the recommendation to the families the
adopter opted into via
[`<committed-lock>` → `skill-families`](install.md#step-5--pick-the-skill-families-and-mcp-servers):

- **`security` family** —
  - `mcp__claude_ai_Gmail__get_thread`
  - `mcp__claude_ai_Gmail__search_threads`
  - `mcp__claude_ai_Gmail__list_drafts`
  - `mcp__claude_ai_Gmail__list_labels`
  - `mcp__gmail-plaintext__create_draft`
  - `mcp__ponymail__search_list`
  - `mcp__ponymail__auth_status`
  - `mcp__ponymail__get_thread`
  - `mcp__ponymail__get_email`
  - `mcp__ponymail__list_restrictions`
  - `mcp__apache-projects__project_stats`
  - `mcp__apache-projects__get_committee`
  - `mcp__apache-projects__get_group_members`
  - `mcp__apache-projects__get_person`
  - `mcp__apache-projects__search_people`
  - `Bash(vulnogram-api-record-fetch *)`

  (The `mcp__apache-projects__*` read tools back the roster /
  affiliation lookups — also used by `contributor-nomination`,
  the maintainer-side <governance-body>/committer assessment skill. Both MCP
  servers are installed from the latest `main` of `apache/comdev`;
  see [`tools/apache-projects/tool.md`](../../../../tools/apache-projects/tool.md)
  and [`tools/ponymail/tool.md`](../../../../tools/ponymail/tool.md).)

- **Any family that ships docs / markdown** (effectively
  every adopter, since the framework itself ships docs) —
  - `Bash(lychee *)` — read-only link-checker invoked by
    the *"run lychee before pushing a PR"* hygiene gate
    documented in [`AGENTS.md`](../../../../AGENTS.md).

The recommended list is **deliberately narrow** — every
entry is read-only, scoped to a specific tool, and
verified against Claude Code's auto-allowed harness
exclusions (`READONLY_COMMANDS`, `GIT_READ_ONLY_COMMANDS`,
`GH_READ_ONLY_COMMANDS`, etc.) so the framework does not
redundantly propose entries that never prompt anyway.

**Implementation.** The classification logic and the atomic
edit path are factored out into the
[`tools/permission-audit`](../../../../tools/permission-audit/README.md)
CLI; the canonical forbidden + recommended-by-family lists
live in
[`tools/permission-audit/src/permission_audit/audit.py`](../../../../tools/permission-audit/src/permission_audit/audit.py).
The skill invokes the CLI once per settings file:

```bash
uv run --project <framework>/tools/permission-audit \
  permission-audit audit <repo>/.claude/settings.local.json \
  --families <comma-joined families from the lock>
```

The CLI emits structured JSON the skill folds into the verify
report. Exit code `1` from the CLI maps to ✗ on this check.

**Reporting shape:** group findings by file, then by bucket.
For each forbidden entry, print the exact JSON-pointer-style
path (`.permissions.allow[<index>]`) the CLI returned so the
operator can locate it instantly; for each recommended entry
missing, print the suggested string verbatim ready for paste.
**Do not auto-write the files** — the per-machine
`settings.local.json` is the operator's; surface the proposal
and let `setup verify --apply-permission-audit`
(interactive) or a hand-edit close the gap. The apply path
calls

```bash
uv run --project <framework>/tools/permission-audit \
  permission-audit apply <repo>/.claude/settings.local.json \
  --add '<entry>' --remove '<entry>' ...
```

which holds a POSIX `fcntl.flock` advisory exclusive lock on
the target file, re-parses under the lock, mutates
`.permissions.allow[]` in place, writes to a sibling temp
file, and `os.replace`s into place — so concurrent
`setup-isolated-setup-install` (which also writes to the same
file's `sandbox.filesystem.*` arrays) does not silently
clobber the diff. When the target file lives at a path the
agent's sandbox marks as `denyWithinAllow` (the per-machine
settings files typically are), the apply path requires the
operator to authorise the sandbox bypass for that single write
— it does not silently skip the file. ⚠ if either file is
absent (most adopters will have at least
`settings.local.json` after the first
`setup-isolated-setup-install` pass; absence is a soft signal
not a hard fault).

**Why we propose, never auto-apply.** The allow-list is
the operator's *capability surface* for the agent in this
checkout. Even an objectively-safer edit (drop a
known-dangerous wildcard) is a capability change the
operator must own, both to know it happened and to keep
the audit trail human-readable. The framework's job is to
*surface* the gap — the operator's job is to close it.

### 8e. comdev MCP prerequisites (ASF projects)

**Run this check only for ASF projects.**

<!-- BEGIN MAGPIE BLOCK: asf-detection — generated from tools/dev/blocks/asf-detection.md -->

Detect ASF the same way as
[`install.md` Step 9c](install.md#step-9c--comdev-mcp-prerequisites-asf-projects):
`<project-config>/project.md` declares `project_metadata.mandatory:
true` or `Mail sources` `ponymail` `mandatory: yes`. Skip otherwise
(the two MCP servers are optional for non-ASF adopters).

<!-- END MAGPIE BLOCK: asf-detection -->

For ASF projects, both the
[PonyMail](../../../../tools/ponymail/tool.md) and
[Apache Projects](../../../../tools/apache-projects/tool.md) MCP
servers are mandatory pre-flight prerequisites, installed from the
latest `main` of `apache/comdev` (tracked, not pinned). Confirm:

1. **Registered.** `mcp__ponymail__*` and `mcp__apache-projects__*`
   appear in the session tool list. ✗ on either missing — the
   mandatory pre-flight gates in `security-issue-import` /
   `security-issue-sync` (PonyMail) and `contributor-nomination`
   (Apache Projects) will hard-stop. Remediation:
   [`install.md` Step 9c](install.md#step-9c--comdev-mcp-prerequisites-asf-projects).
2. **PonyMail authenticated.** For ASF projects an authenticated
   LDAP session is required, not just a registered server — a
   trivial `mcp__ponymail__auth_status()` should report an
   authenticated session. ⚠ if registered but unauthenticated
   (remediation: `mcp__ponymail__login()`).
3. **Checkout on `main`, current.** Resolve each server's checkout
   root from its `mcpServers` `args` path and confirm `origin` is
   `apache/comdev`, the branch is `main`, and it is not behind the
   last-fetched `origin/main`. This is the read-only, offline form
   of the freshness assertion; the authoritative live fetch belongs
   to [`setup upgrade` Step 6e](upgrade.md#step-6e--refresh-comdev-mcp-checkouts-asf-projects)
   and [`setup-isolated-setup-update`](../isolated-setup-update/SKILL.md).
    ✗ off-`main` or non-`apache/comdev` remote; ⚠ behind
    `origin/main`.

### 8f. Auto-sourced config fields drift check

Verify that the auto-sourced stable configuration fields in
`.apache-magpie-overrides/project.md` are in sync with the repository's live
metadata:

- Always (organization-agnostic): `upstream_repo`, `upstream_default_branch`,
  `product_family_url`, `labels` — from `gh repo view`.
- **Only when `organization: ASF`**: the mailing lists, against the current
  `.asf.yaml`. Skip the `.asf.yaml` comparison for a non-ASF `organization`
  (an `independent` project has no `.asf.yaml` to drift against — not a finding).
- ⚠ if any value has changed or drifted (e.g. the default branch changed from `master` to `main`, or — for ASF projects — mailing-list routing in `.asf.yaml` was updated). Recommend running `setup upgrade` to re-derive and align the committed configuration with the new metadata.

### 9. Project documentation mentions the framework

Two files to check (per
[`install.md` Step 11](install.md#step-11--project-doc-updates-fresh-only)):

- **`<repo-root>/README.md`** — should have a contributor-facing
  section (typically `## Agent-assisted contribution
  (apache-magpie)`) that mentions the snapshot mechanism, the
  `setup` invocation for fresh clones, the
  `.apache-magpie.lock` pin, and `.apache-magpie-overrides/`.
  Grep for `apache-magpie` and `setup` together as a
  proxy. ⚠ if either token is absent.
- **`<repo-root>/AGENTS.md`** — if the file exists, it should
  have an `## apache-magpie framework` section that
  cross-references the README section. Grep for
  `apache-magpie` and a link to the README anchor. ⚠ if the
  file exists but lacks the section; not applicable if the
  file does not exist (do not create one just to satisfy
  the check).

Cheap to skip if both are absent on a minimal repo — surface
as ⚠ overall only, never ✗. `CONTRIBUTING.md` counts as a
fallback for `README.md` if the adopter declared it so during
adoption.

### 10. Trusted external source snapshots + symlinks

Only when `<project-config>/skill-sources.md` (the trust list)
lists at least one source — otherwise skip this check silently
(the adopter runs in-tree skills only). For each trusted source
([`skill-sources.md`](skill-sources.md)):

- **Committed pin present.** The source has a block in
  `.apache-magpie.sources.lock` (`method`/`url`/`ref` + anchor).
  Missing ⇒ ✗: the trust list vouches for a source that was never
  pinned — run `setup skill-sources`.
- **Snapshot present.** `.apache-magpie-sources/<id>/` exists on
  disk with the source's `skills_root`. Missing ⇒ ✗ with the
  remediation `setup skill-sources` (the fetch is
  gitignored, so a fresh clone has none — expected, same as the
  framework snapshot).
- **Source drift.** The source's committed block vs its
  `.apache-magpie.sources.local.lock` block — a mismatch ⇒ ⚠ and
  proposes `setup upgrade`, exactly like framework drift
  (check 3).
- **Symlinks live.** Every `magpie-<name>` the source `provides`
  resolves through the canonical
  `.agents/skills/magpie-<name>` → `../../.apache-magpie-sources/<id>/skills/<name>/`
  and its relays (same rule as check 5). Dangling / misdirected ⇒
  ✗ with `setup verify --auto-fix-symlinks`.
- **No name collision.** No `magpie-<name>` provided by a source
  shadows a framework skill or another source's skill. Collision
  ⇒ ✗ (surface, do not auto-resolve).

### 8g. Codex project profile (if present)

When `<repo-root>/.codex/config.toml` exists, validate the committed
Codex policy with:

```bash
uv run --project tools/sandbox-lint sandbox-lint --codex <repo-root>/.codex
```

- ✓ on a clean pass.
- ✗ on any invariant violation (sandbox mode, workspace network
  access, approval policy, or missing exec-policy coverage) — surface
  the violations for review. A conflicting adopter value is never
  silently weakened; the remediation is `setup` (adopt or
  upgrade), which shows the diff and asks.

When `.codex/` is absent this check is skipped — the Codex profile is
opt-in per runtime; see
[the Codex adapter](../../../../docs/adapters/codex.md).

### 8h. Gemini project profile (if present)

When the workspace has a Magpie Gemini policy or guard registration, run the static checks in
[the Gemini verification contract](../../../../docs/adapters/gemini.md#verify).
Report missing components and configuration drift without modifying files.
An absent profile is skipped unless Gemini secure setup was requested; in that case, point to `setup-isolated-setup-install`.
A static pass does not replace live verification in Gemini.

### 8i. Adversarial reviewers (if configured)

When `adversarial-review.md` resolves (the personal layer first, then
`.apache-magpie-overrides/`), run the tool's `detect` in its one-line form —
`uvx --from ~/.claude/magpie/adversarial-review adversarial-review detect`,
unquoted with a literal `~` — and compare
it with the configured `reviewers`.

- ✓ when every configured reviewer is available, or is `self` (skipped
  by design).
- ⚠ for each configured reviewer whose CLI is missing or whose
  `--version` probe fails, with the reason `detect` gave. A warning, never a
  failure: reviews are advisory, and a PR is never blocked by an
  unavailable reviewer. The remediation is to install or log in to that
  CLI, or to drop it with `/magpie-setup config adversarial-review`.
- ⚠ when a configuration names reviewers but the `magpie-adversarial-review`
  plugin is not installed: print
  `/plugin install magpie-adversarial-review@apache-magpie`.
- ⚠ for each harness command under the user's home
  (`~/.codex/prompts/magpie-adversarial-review.md`,
  `~/.gemini/commands/magpie-adversarial-review.toml`) that differs from
  what `adversarial-review commands --harness <name>` prints for the
  installed plugin — the command text changed in a newer plugin. The
  remediation is `/magpie-setup config adversarial-review`, which shows the
  difference and asks.

`detect` makes no model call, so a logged-out CLI passes here and shows up
as `unavailable` in the report of the first real review. Say so.

When no `adversarial-review.md` resolves, this check is skipped.

### 11. Reconciliation sweep (read-only)

Runs the identical two checks
[`reconcile.md` → The sweep](reconcile.md#the-sweep) performs — anchor
resolution and `requires_config` resolution, over the identical scope
(every skill named by a file under the personal layer or
`.apache-magpie-overrides/`) — and reports the findings in the same
shape. This is the same contract reused read-only, not a
re-implementation: no baseline needed, the same two checks, the same
sandboxed-session degradation (`reconcile.md` check 4 — an unreadable
target `SKILL.md` goes in `unchecked`, never reported as clean).

**Read-only here.** Unlike `reconcile`, this check never confirms,
applies, or writes the `reconciled:` stamp — it reports what a sweep
would find and names `/magpie-setup reconcile` as where to act on it.
`verify` is invoked freely and often, including by the pre-flight nudge
below (check 10 of
[`tools/dev/preflight-block.md`](../../../../tools/dev/preflight-block.md));
a health-check sub-action should never itself mutate committed or
local state beyond the always-local `verified_at` it writes on
completion (see [Writing `verified_at`](#writing-verified_at) below).

- ✓ no configuration or adoption surface at all
  ([`reconcile.md` Step 0.1](reconcile.md#step-0--pre-flight)) —
  nothing to reconcile, not a fault.
- ✓ every override anchor resolves and every `requires_config` entry
  resolves.
- ⚠ an anchor moved, a `requires_config` entry no longer resolves, or
  no `reconciled:` block exists anywhere (or one exists but never
  covered this skill) — report the same numbered-proposal shape
  [`reconcile.md` Step 1](reconcile.md#step-1--present-the-findings)
  produces; remediation: `/magpie-setup reconcile`.
- List any `unchecked` skills from the sandboxed-session degradation
  and say plainly that resolving them needs an unsandboxed
  `/magpie-setup reconcile` run.
- A `skills` entry for the same skill present in **both** the
  committed lock and the local file is the expected transitional state
  [`reconcile.md` Step 0.3](reconcile.md#step-0--pre-flight)
  describes — config on one machine, adopt on another — not a fault.
  The local entry wins; name the collision and point at
  `/magpie-setup reconcile`, which offers to drop the redundant local
  entry. Do not resolve it here.

### 12. Latest available plugin version

The one comparison no other surface performs — see
[Why this surface owns the comparison](#why-this-surface-owns-the-comparison)
below.

1. Resolve the marketplace clone: `claude plugin marketplace list
   --json`, and read the `apache-magpie` entry's `installLocation`
   (typically a full git clone at
   `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/apache-magpie`).
2. Read that clone's `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, which lists
   every plugin the marketplace ships with its version.
3. Read the installed set: `claude plugin list --json` (fields
   `id`, `version`, `scope`, `enabled`, `installPath`, `installedAt`,
   `lastUpdated`).
4. For every installed Magpie plugin, compare its installed `version`
   against the clone's version for that plugin id, **as PEP 440,
   dev segment included** — `0.2.0.dev202609211315` is newer than
   `0.2.0.dev202609180100`, and is reported as the available update
   it is. Nothing strips `.devN` or rounds to the release segment.

- ✓ every installed plugin is at or above the clone's version —
  report no per-plugin entries.
- ⚠ an installed plugin is behind the clone's version — name it, its
  installed version, and the clone's version; remediation:
  `claude plugin marketplace update apache-magpie` then `claude
  plugin update <plugin>@apache-magpie` (or the client-appropriate
  equivalent named in
  [Marketplace-install checks](#marketplace-install-checks) above).
- **An unreadable clone is reported as "could not check", never as
  "up to date".** Either `claude plugin marketplace list --json`
  fails to resolve `installLocation`, or the resolved clone's
  `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` cannot be read — inside a
  sandboxed session the plugin cache is denied, exactly as it is for
  check 11 above — do not compare anything; report the comparison as
  unchecked and say why: this session could not read the marketplace
  clone, not that it found no update.

#### Why this surface owns the comparison

`verify` is the only surface run deliberately and unsandboxed often
enough to read the marketplace clone routinely — invoked by the
operator directly, outside the sandboxed harness that denies the
plugin cache to every other skill's pre-flight. The shared pre-flight
block's own per-skill reconciliation check (see
[`tools/dev/preflight-block.md`](../../../../tools/dev/preflight-block.md)
step 4) never performs this comparison: it compares a skill's own
`surface_hash` against the stamp, which is free and works inside the
sandbox, while reading the marketplace clone is neither. That split is
deliberate, not an oversight to close later — see
[`docs/designs/2026-09-21-marketplace-reconciliation-tracking.md`](../../../../docs/designs/2026-09-21-marketplace-reconciliation-tracking.md#the-three-numbers-and-where-each-comes-from).

## Writing `verified_at`

Every run of this sub-action that reaches the report — clean or with
findings, on any of the three branches above (including
[Local self-adoption checks](#local-self-adoption-checks), which
skips checks 11 and 12 but still completes a run) — writes today's
date as `verified_at` into the personal layer's `reconciled.json`
(the `personal_dir` above), creating the file (and the directory, if
absent) when neither exists yet — never an in-tree
`.apache-magpie-local/` in a repo that has not adopted Magpie. This is the always-local key the shared pre-flight block's
end-of-run clock reads (step 10 of
[`tools/dev/preflight-block.md`](../../../../tools/dev/preflight-block.md))
to decide whether to suggest `verify` again; per
[`locks.md`](locks.md#the-reconciled-block--what-was-checked-not-what-to-install)
`verified_at` is never committed, even inside an adopted project's
`.apache-magpie.lock`. A run that stops in pre-flight (not installed,
wrong checkout for a committed-lock write) has not completed and
writes nothing.

## Committed default set

Read `.claude/settings.json` at the repo root and compare its committed
`enabledPlugins` block against the floor — the `plugins` list in
`.apache-magpie.lock`, in floor order, each as `<plugin>@apache-magpie`.
`adopt` *seeds* that list with `magpie-setup`, `magpie-utilities` and
`magpie-agent-guard`, and a project whose maintainers enlarged the floor
carries more, so read the lock rather than assuming a count; with no lock in
evidence, the seeded three stand. This block is written by
[`adopt`](adopt.md) (Claude Code only) to record that floor in the repo;
committing it is optional and is not required to use the plugins in this repo.

- **No `enabledPlugins` key** — ✓, status `absent`. Report it in one line
  as available but not in use, and move on. **This is not a fault.** A
  project that never took the offer, or took it and later removed it, is
  correctly configured. Do not count it as a failed check, and do not
  offer to write it here — `/magpie-setup adopt` is where the floor is
  recorded. There is no block to diff the floor against, so `missing` is
  empty: the floor's entries are not "missing" from a block that does not
  exist.
- **Every floor member present** — ✓, status `current`. Also not a
  fault.
- **Some but not all of the floor members present** — ✗, status
  `stale`. This is the only case this check treats as a fault: it is
  drift, typically produced by a framework release that changed the
  floor. Name the missing members — the floor entries above that are not
  present, listed in floor order — and offer to add them under the merge
  rules in [`adopt.md`](adopt.md#merge-rules).
- **A member naming a plugin the marketplace no longer ships** — ✗, same
  treatment as drift. Offer to drop that entry.

The glyph carries the fault rule: ✓ covers both correctly-configured end
states, absent and current alike; ✗ is reserved for the one state this
check treats as a fault, stale (and the retired-plugin case above it).

## Adoption floor

Read `.apache-magpie.lock`. This check applies only to
`method: marketplace`; the three snapshot methods are covered by the
drift check above.

- **No lock** → `not-adopted`. **This is not a fault.** A project that
  has not adopted Magpie is a supported end state, and every *install*
  in it works exactly as it does anywhere else. What an unadopted repo
  does not have is a committed project config, so a skill that needs one
  will still stop and ask — that is a missing configuration, not a
  broken install. Report it in one line and move on.
- **A floor plugin the marketplace no longer ships** →
  `unshippable-plugin`, a fault. Check this first, before absence or
  version: a plugin the marketplace has dropped has no install state to
  evaluate, so it is never also counted as `below`. List it in the
  shortfall, in floor order, the same as a `below` finding. Do **not**
  offer to install around it. The project's floor names something that
  no longer exists, which is a fact for a maintainer to fix in a PR
  against this repo — say so, and name `setup adopt` as where the
  floor is edited.
- **A still-shipped floor plugin absent, or below `min_version`** →
  `below`, a fault. List the shortfall in floor order and offer the
  repair: the same install/update the pre-flight would run. **If the
  lock's `url` is anything other than `apache/magpie`, say in the offer
  which marketplace the repair would install from**, naming it — an
  offer the user cannot see the source of is not a report, and the lock
  is a committed file in whatever repository they happened to open. See
  [`locks.md`](locks.md#url-is-a-security-boundary).
- **Every floor plugin still shipped, installed at or above
  `min_version`** → `met`, not a fault. Being *ahead* of the floor is
  the normal case, and extra plugins beyond the floor are the
  contributor's business — neither is reported as a finding.

Compare versions as PEP 440
([`locks.md`](locks.md#method-marketplace--the-adoption-floor)), never
as strings.

## After the report

If every check is ✓ (or ⚠ on items the adopter has
intentionally opted out of), say so explicitly and stop.

If anything is ✗, end the report with a concrete next-step
list, ordered most → least urgent:

- ✗ on check 1 → `setup upgrade` (re-fetches per
  the committed lock).
- ✗ on check 3 (drift) → `setup upgrade`.
- ✗ on check 5 (dangling symlinks) →
  `setup verify --auto-fix-symlinks` (cheap;
  no-op when symlinks already correct).
- ✗ on check 6 → `setup install` (idempotent
  re-create).
- ✗ on check 4 / SHA-512 mismatch → **investigate first**;
  do not run upgrade until you understand why the
  released zip changed under the same version.
- ⚠ on check 8c (stale agent-worktree, no uncommitted
  changes) → `git worktree remove <path>` per the
  per-worktree proposal in the report. Idempotent; safe to
  batch across all flagged worktrees in one pass.
- ✗ on check 8c (stale agent-worktree, **uncommitted
  changes present**) → operator decision required. The
  proposal lists each affected worktree with its branch
  + diff summary; recover via `EnterWorktree(path)` (or
  `cd <path>` outside the harness) to inspect, then either
  commit / push or stash, then `git worktree remove --force
  <path>`. Never propose `--force` without first
  surfacing the diff.
- ✗ on check 8d (forbidden allow-list entry — arbitrary
  code execution) → propose removing the named entry from
  the file's `permissions.allow[]` array. Print the JSON-
  pointer path so the operator can locate it. Per-machine
  `settings.local.json` writes go via
  `setup verify --apply-permission-audit`
  (interactive, atomic JSON edit, sandbox-bypass requires
  per-write authorisation). Committed `settings.json`
  writes are a regular file edit + commit; flag them
  loudly because they bind every developer on the project.
- ⚠ on check 8d (recommended allow-list entry missing) →
  optional. Print the suggested string ready for paste;
  apply via the same `--apply-permission-audit` flag, or
  paste manually. The recommendation is family-scoped, so
  an adopter who skipped the `security` family will not
  see the Gmail / PonyMail entries surfaced as gaps.
- ✗ on check 8e (ASF project, comdev MCP not registered or
  off-`main`) → `setup install` Step 9c to (re-)install
  from latest `apache/comdev` `main`. ⚠ on check 8e (PonyMail
  unauthenticated, or checkout behind `origin/main`) →
  `mcp__ponymail__login()` and/or `setup upgrade`
  Step 6e (live fetch + `git pull --ff-only`).
- ⚠ on check 11 (reconciliation sweep finding, or `unchecked`
  skills) → `/magpie-setup reconcile` (outside the sandbox, if the
  skills were left `unchecked`).
- ⚠ on check 12 (installed plugin behind the marketplace clone) →
  `claude plugin marketplace update apache-magpie` then `claude
  plugin update <plugin>@apache-magpie` (or the client-appropriate
  equivalent). Unchecked (unreadable clone) → no remediation to
  propose; note that the comparison could not run here.
- All other ✗ / ⚠ → name the gap, give the one-line
  remediation.
